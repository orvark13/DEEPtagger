# DEEPtagger
PoS Tagging with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Models

###### train.py
A bidirectional LSTM model can be trained by running train.py.

./train.py -h gives information on all possible parameters.
The program requires input corpora to be in the same format as the IFD-training/testing sets, available at http://www.malfong.is/index.php?lang=en&pg=ordtidnibok

Results from experiments with different models, trained on the IFD, are here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YG8xYaW10x4jvsCFyHkQxdYQLIOFa6WoBUzbA4y4Gtg/edit?usp=sharing
